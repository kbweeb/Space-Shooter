# Space Shooter Game

Welcome to the **Space Shooter** game! This is a simple 2D space shooter game where the player controls a spaceship, shoots bullets at enemies, and earns points by destroying them. The game features smooth movement, shooting mechanics, and collision detection, making for an engaging experience.

## Features

- **Player Movement**: The player can move their spaceship up, down, left, and right using timers.
- **Shooting Mechanism**: The player can shoot bullets by pressing the **spacebar**. Bullets move upwards and destroy enemies on impact.
- **Enemies**: Red enemy spaceships randomly appear at the top and move downwards. When destroyed, they reset to the top of the screen.
- **Collision Detection**: Bullets collide with enemies, and upon impact, enemies are reset to the top of the screen, and the player's score is incremented.
- **Score System**: The score is displayed at the top-left of the screen and increases as enemies are destroyed.
- **Background**: A simple moving background with stars creates a dynamic visual environment for the game.
